Slide 1 - introl me

How I got interested in functional

- Saw a talk on F# - thought this is very cool and makes sense for my brain
- As a kid I was terrible at numeracy but when algebra came along, that clicked
- but I'm a php/js developer
- Then elm - few years later, when the js ecosystem was really creaking around 2016
- along with the static typing system elm really made sense for me
- Been an active member of the elm community since then

Slide 2 - talk outline
===

It's a big topic. I'm not going to teach it to you
 give you the tools and vocabulary to get started
 Dispell a few myths and show that it's for everyone
Steeped in academia
I'll try to use plain language, so might not always be strictly accurate in a mathematical sense. My intention is to give access to the ideas, not make you a master.
By the end hope you start to recognise
 where you already use it
 when you are making a choice to use or not

 Lambda Calculus heart function composition
  - anonymous - they do not need to be named or assigned to a variable
  - unary - only accept one parameter so if you need more than one, curry (n-ary)
  - first-class - they can be inputs and they can return other functions

obvious benefits

easy to learn (small building blocks)
Object oriented is about relationships and networks - and we all know that's a very complicated landscape to keep track of.
